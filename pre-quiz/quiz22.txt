Graph coloring is:
(select one) --
[ ] O(N)
[ ] O(N^2)
[ ] O(N^3)
[ ] O(N^4)
[✔️] O(2^N)
[ ] Really hard.

# 2.
Table 25.1 shows that an adjacency list + hash table has Big-O runtimes as good or better than an adjacency matrix in every case.
Suggest a reason why we might still want to use an adjacency matrix.
(string) ---
In same cases when checking if there is a edge between two nodes takes O(1) time for adjacency matrix while O(n) time in adjacency list.

# 3.
The book describes a generic search algorithm which can operate with different data structures holding the list to edges to examine next.  What kind of search do you get if you use:
  a. Stack
  b. Queue
  c. Priority queue

A. DFS
B. BFS
C. Minimum spanning tree 

# 4.
List at least three algorithms discussed in this chapter which are NP-complete.
(string) ---
