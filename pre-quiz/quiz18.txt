There is a *lot* of terminology all at once here.  To get a handle on it, draw a Venn diagram of the following categories, and bring it with you to class.
  * graph
  * connected graph
  * tree
  * rooted tree
  * full tree
  * balanced tree
  * complete tree

In the binary tree shown in Figure 22.7.a, where would the number 78 go?
(select one) ---
[ ] To the right of 43
[ ] To the left of 59
[ ] To the right of 59
[✔️] To the left of 99

# 3.
If we have the tree: (you'll have to imagine the edges)

            23
      18          44 
   3     22    35    78
    16
      17

Write the result of printing this tree using an inorder traversal:
(string) ---
3 16 17 18 22 23 35 44 78

# 4.
Write the result of printing the above tree using a preorder traversal:
(string) ---
23 18 3 16 17 22 44 35 78

# 5.
Write the result of printing the above tree using a postorder traversal:
(string) ---
17 16 3 22 18 35 78 44 23
